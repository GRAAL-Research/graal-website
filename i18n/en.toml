  other = """The main focus of the Group for Research in Artificial Intellience of Laval University (GRAIL) is machine learning theory and applications.
  Our group strives to understand how learning theory can offer strong guaranties on the accuracy of learned models. Moreover, our group is at the forefront of practical applications of artificial intelligence, with research projects in language processing, bioinformatics, big data, and learning theory. Our work impacts drug discovery, personalized medicine, medical diagnostic, risk evaluation in insurance, software security, safety in social networks, and more.
  <br /><br />
  The GRAIL is part of the <a href="//www.ift.ulaval.ca">Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering</a> at <a href="//ulaval.ca">Universit&eacute; Laval</a> and is led by Professors Fran√ßois Laviolette, Mario Marchand, Jacques Corbeil, Luc Lamontagne, Richard Khoury, and Audrey Durand.
